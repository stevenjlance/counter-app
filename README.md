Who doesn't love a counting? Many apps take in user input and change the display once a certain condition is met.

## GOAL
We are going to make an app that responds to user input and prints out a message when a user counts to a certain value.

## TASKS
For today's lab you should do the following:  
1. Declare a variable called `var counter` and initialize it with a value of 0.  
2. Using `document.querySelector()`, select for the the up and down arrow.
3. Using `.addEventListener`, get the console to print "clicked!" when the up or down arrow are clicked.
4. Update the counter variable you declared in step 2 using everytime the up or down arrow are clicked. Print the new count to the console.
5. Update the value of counter on the index.html with the new value stored in `var counter`. The value on the screen should update as you press the up and down arrows.
6. Using `innerHTML` get a message to print to the screen when a certain counter value is reached.
7. **CHALLENGE**: Update the screen with a message for the user when they reach a certain value so that they cannot count anymore (see gif about under GOAL for an example of what this can look like).
